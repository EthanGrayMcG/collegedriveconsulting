                  While there is not necessarily a “perfect” time to begin, most students begin the college counseling
                  process during their junior year of high school. Students in their freshman or sophomore years,
                  though, can also use these resources to prepare for what’s ahead, and navigate their high school
                  experiences to best align with college criteria. College Drive also works with graduating seniors,
                  emphasizing planning and organization.

                  The average public school counselor is responsible for 300+ students each year. In using College
                  Drive, you will be provided with guidance specifically catered to you, your individual interests and
                  experiences, and your college application and selection goals. With 4000+ colleges and universities in
                  the U.S., it can be difficult to fully explore all of your options. You will receive one-on-one
                  counseling as well as support via email in order to ease the stress of the application process and
                  make sure that you are aware of all deadlines, requirements, and processes. In addition, if
                  applicable, the college counseling services will provide you with opportunities to connect with
                  current students, administrators, and faculty at the colleges you might be interested in.

                  College Drive offers individual guidance to meet your personal needs and timeline, provides support
                  from a counselor with an expertise in colleges and universities and with in-depth experience working
                  with clients in the counseling role, offers flexible scheduling and communication options, and
                  provides you with a counselor who cares about your decisions about your future as much as you do. Val
                  also works very hard to try to provide support in the way today’s students are most interested in
                  receiving it, through both traditional methods (e.g., individual meetings and phone conversations) as
                  well as methods more relevant to today’s generation of students (e.g., text message reminders). She
                  tries to remain as accessible to students and families as possible, especially during the peak times
                  of the stress and anxiety that is associated with the college admissions process.
